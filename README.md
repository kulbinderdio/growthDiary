# Growth Diary

After reading and watching far too many books and videos on self improvement and productivity and many other areas of self help I decided I needed a way of 
easily implementing some of the things I had learnt into my daily life. Growth Diary is there result of that.

It is written in Python using Flask (2 other things I have ben learning recently). I wanted something I could create quiickly and start using. 
The code is far from perfect and there are many improvments and functionality that I would like to add. Time will tell if I (or someone else) adds them.

The premise for this is simple. You select the required date and enter the information and press save (no check functionality yet if you navigate away with saving)

At the top is a scrolling list of news stories about 'personal improvement' from Google News.
The Headline item is that one thing you have to get done on that day, above all other things
Gratitude is about noticing and appreciating things in your life and many studies have shown this can have a very positive impact on your own mental wellbeing
Today's Goals - Yoou should be setting yourself yearly, quarterly and monthly goals. This area is to help you achieve those by breaking them down into smaller daily goals
Notes is for you to keep a record of the day, what went well, what didn't, how would you change things, etc

A good practise is to complete the week's Headline items and goals on a Sunday evening ready for tthe day ahead. Write down those things that clutter up your brain.

## Setup
1. Requires Python
2. set up environment by using requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. python diary.py

## Improvements 
1. I have thought about adding a TO DO list. In fact the HTML page has some layoout code for this that has been commented out. I'm currently in 2 minds about whether 
this applicztion should have a To Do list
2. No check if yoou have updated any information and the decide to navigate away without saving first
3. May this a multi user application with login functionality
4. The requirements document has far too many unused libraries in there, a consequence of the mess that my machine is in
5. Dockerize


I have put a plug in the top right hand corner for Amazon. Feel free to change, delete oor if you fancy it click it.
